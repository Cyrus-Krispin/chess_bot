# Chess Game in React

A simple, interactive chess game built with React and TypeScript. This project demonstrates basic chessboard rendering, piece movement, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Features
- **Chessboard Rendering**: Displays an 8x8 chessboard with alternating light and dark squares.
- **Draggable Pieces**: Chess pieces can be dragged and dropped to move them across the board.
- **Move Logging**: Logs piece movements (type, color, and source/destination) in the console.
- **React and TypeScript**: Built using modern React and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.


## Future Improvements
- Implement turn-based logic to alternate between players.
- Add move validation to ensure only legal moves are allowed.
- Highlight valid moves for selected pieces.
- Incorporate a chess engine for advanced gameplay.
